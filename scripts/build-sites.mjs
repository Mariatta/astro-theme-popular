/**
 * Build the published deployment: the neutral starter at the root, the four
 * flavored demos at their subpaths, and the gallery landing page at /demos/.
 *
 *   node scripts/build-sites.mjs <site-origin> <base-prefix> <output-dir>
 *   node scripts/build-sites.mjs https://you.github.io /astro-theme-popular public
 *   node scripts/build-sites.mjs "$DEPLOY_PRIME_URL" "" public
 *
 * Used by .github/workflows/deploy-demo.yml (GitHub Pages, production) and by
 * the Netlify preview build (see AGENTS.md, "Settings that live outside this
 * repo"). One script so a preview cannot quietly differ from production.
 *
 * The starter is at the root deliberately. The root is the URL people are
 * given, including as the Demo link in the Astro theme catalogue, whose
 * reviewers require it to be a live deployment of the repo "exactly as a new
 * user will get". That is the starter, and it is what `npm create
 * popular-site@latest` writes. The root used to be the hand-written gallery,
 * which is not an Astro build at all and fails that check on inspection.
 *
 * Since phase 3 each demo is its own workspace consuming the package, so this
 * builds them where they live. That makes the deployment an integration test:
 * five real consumers, five configs, built from the same package an adopter
 * installs.
 *
 * Each site is built with Astro's own `--base`, which is what makes every
 * link, image, feed and canonical URL land under its own prefix.
 *
 * Set POPULAR_PREVIEW_NOTE to render the preview banner on every page (the
 * env-var switch is meant for exactly this: a build nobody owns).
 *
 * Not part of the theme. Adopters who copy this repo never run it.
